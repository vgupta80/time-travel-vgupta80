# Time Travel Zine Project

I am learning Git version control and collaborative development workflows through creating a time-travel themed digital magazine. This project demonstrates branching strategies, pull requests, issue tracking, and merge conflict resolution using a creative zine format.

## .gitignore

The `.gitignore` excludes editor-specific files and OS-generated artifacts to keep the repository clean. This prevents personal IDE settings and system files like `.DS_Store` from being committed, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

## Branch Strategy

### `author/idea-sprint`
Used for rapid content creation and initial drafts. Authors brainstorm and write new zine content freely without focusing on perfection.

### `editor/review`
Used for editorial review and content refinement. Editors polish and improve content before merging to main.
